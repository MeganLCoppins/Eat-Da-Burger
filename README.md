# Eat-Da-Burger

I created this application with Node, Express, and Handlebars. Eat-Da-Burger is a burger logging application that allows you to:

* View a list of burgers that have either been devoured or not

* Update whether a burger has not been devoured or is devoured

* Add burgers and select whether the burger is devoured or not

* Delete selected burgers
